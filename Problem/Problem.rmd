## Is there a difference in  average years of education (EDUC) between the those who did or did not vote in 2012 (VOTE12)?

$H_O$ : No difference in average years of education between those who voted and those who did vote in 2012

$H_A$ : Yes there is a difference in average years of education between those who voted and those who did not vote in 2012

## graphical summary  

```{r}
plot(EDUC~VOTE12,data=Ourdata)

```


It appears that the average number of years of education is about the same for both groups
